# EV Adoption Forecasting

This project analyzes Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption patterns using machine learning techniques. The analysis is performed on county-level EV population data to understand and forecast EV adoption trends.

## Overview

The project uses a Random Forest Regressor to analyze and predict EV adoption rates based on various geographical and demographic factors. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning model implementation.

## Dataset

The project uses the "Electric Vehicle Population By County" dataset (`Electric_Vehicle_Population_By_County.csv`) which contains:

- County and State information
- Electric Vehicle (EV) totals
- Percentage of electric vehicles
- Temporal data (Date)
- Total of 20,819 data points with 10 features

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Key Libraries:
  - pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
  - numpy: Numerical computations
  - scikit-learn: Machine learning implementation
  - seaborn & matplotlib: Data visualization
  - joblib: Model persistence

## Features

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   - DateTime conversion
   - Missing value handling
   - Outlier detection and treatment using IQR method

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
